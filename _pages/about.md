I am currently pursuing B.E from Vesit, Mumbai. I love technology and that's why I choose the field of Computer Engineering. I like Exploring various domains like System Design, Computer Architecture, Machine Learning, etc. . One day I would love to change the world and impact everyone just like my inspiration and ultimate rival Elon Musk.

I am looking to sharpen my skill set and abilities to solve complex real-world problems by taking on a Summer Internship opportunity in engineering, robotics, computer science, machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.

Specialties: 
- Artificial Intelligence
